## IFrame Experiment with Web3Modal Wallet

This is an experiment intended to work out cross-frame communication needs to
allow parent frame to communicate wallet choices to a child frame.

To run the experiment, do `yarn install` in both `parent` and `child` directories, then `yarn start` in both.

You will want to look at the parent, served on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`, which will wrap the child on port `3001`.
